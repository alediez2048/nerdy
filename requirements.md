Autonomous Content Generation System
Build an Autonomous Ad Engine for Facebook & Instagram That Gets Measurably Better Per Token Spent

The Challenge
Most AI-generated ad copy is mediocre. It reads like it was made by a machine, converts poorly, and costs more to produce than the value it creates.
Your challenge: Build an autonomous system that generates Facebook and Instagram ad copy, knows the difference between good and bad, surfaces only its best work, and measurably improves over time. The north star metric is performance per token—how much quality per dollar of API spend.
This is not a prompt engineering exercise. This is a systems engineering challenge: generate, evaluate, iterate, and improve—with minimal human intervention.
The domain is tight and closed: paid social ads for Facebook and Instagram. That's it. No email, no landing pages, no TikTok. One channel family, one content type, done well.

Why This Matters
Real ad engines produce thousands of creatives across campaigns. The ones that win share a pattern:

Most ads fail. The system that surfaces only its best work wins.
Quality is decomposable. "Good ad copy" is really clarity + value proposition + CTA strength + brand voice + emotional resonance, each independently measurable.
Improvement compounds. A system that tracks what works and feeds it back gets better every cycle.
ROI is the real metric. Not "did the AI generate something?" but "was it worth the tokens?"

Deliverables

Autonomous ad copy generation pipeline for FB/IG
Evaluation framework with atomic quality dimensions
Quality feedback loop demonstrating iterative improvement
Generated ad library with evaluation scores (50+ ads)
Decision log documenting YOUR thinking and judgment calls
Evaluation report (JSON/CSV + summary with quality trends)


What We're Really Evaluating
We're not testing whether you can make an API call. We're evaluating:

Problem decomposition: Can you break "generate good ads" into a system of measurable, improvable parts?
Taste and judgment: Do you know what good looks like? Can you teach a system to know?
Creative Agency: Even if you don't know what good looks like, could you gather context strategically to build a working proof of concept?
Systems thinking: Does your system handle failure? Does it know when it's producing garbage?
Iteration methodology: What did you try, what worked, what didn't, and why?

Your decision log matters as much as your output. A well-reasoned decision log with honest limitations is worth more than a polished demo with no explanation of how you got there.

The Channel: Facebook & Instagram Paid Ads
You're generating ad copy for Meta's paid social platforms. Real Varsity Tutors ads and performance data will be provided in the Gauntlet/Nerdy Slack channel.
What works on Meta right now:

Authentic > polished. UGC-style outperforms studio creative.
Story-driven > feature-list. Pain point → solution → proof → CTA.
Pattern interrupts. Scroll-stopping hooks in the first line.
Social proof (reviews, testimonials, numbers) builds trust.
Emotional resonance > rational argument for awareness; flip for conversion.

Ad anatomy on Meta:

Primary text: The main copy above the image (most important — this is what stops the scroll)
Headline: Bold text below the image (short, punchy)
Description: Secondary text below headline (often truncated on mobile)
CTA button: "Learn More", "Sign Up", "Get Started", etc.
Creative: Image (out of scope for v1, in scope for v2)

"Great artists steal." Study our biggest competitor's ads. What patterns do you see? What hooks work? What CTAs convert? The best ad systems don't invent new formats—they study what works, fit the brand into proven patterns, and iterate. A great way to do this is to grab competitor's ads and then make them our own.

Quality Dimensions
Every generated ad gets scored across these five dimensions:
DimensionWhat It MeasuresScore 1 (Bad)Score 10 (Excellent)ClarityIs the message immediately understandable?Confusing, multiple messages competingCrystal clear single takeaway in <3 secondsValue PropositionDoes it communicate a compelling benefit?Generic/feature-focused ("we have tutors")Specific, differentiated benefit ("raise your SAT score 200+ points")Call to ActionIs the next step clear and compelling?No CTA or vague ("learn more")Specific, urgent, low-friction ("Start your free practice test")Brand VoiceDoes it sound like the brand?Generic, could be anyoneDistinctly on-brand: empowering, knowledgeable, approachableEmotional ResonanceDoes it connect emotionally?Flat, purely rationalTaps into real motivation (parent worry, student ambition, test anxiety)
Quality threshold: 7.0/10 average to be considered publishable. Below that, the system should flag and regenerate.

Scope Variants
Choose your ambition level. All variants are valid submissions.
v1: Ad Copy Pipeline (1-2 days)
Text-only ad copy generation and evaluation.
What you build:

Ad copy generator from minimal briefs (audience + product + goal)
LLM-as-judge evaluation scoring the 5 dimensions above
Feedback loop: generate → evaluate → identify weakest dimension → targeted regeneration → re-evaluate
Quality threshold enforcement: 7.0/10 minimum

Demonstrate:

50+ generated ads with full evaluation scores
Quality improvement over 3+ iteration cycles
Which interventions improved which dimensions

Tech: Single LLM for both generation and evaluation is fine. Rules-based baseline also acceptable.
v2: Multi-Modal Ads (3-5 days)
Everything in v1, plus:

Image generation for ad creatives (Imagen via Gemini API, Flux, etc.)
Visual evaluation (brand consistency, engagement potential)
A/B variant generation—same brief, different creative approaches
Multi-model orchestration with clear rationale for which model does what

v3: Autonomous Ad Engine (1-2 weeks)
Everything in v2, plus:

Self-healing feedback loops (detect quality drops, diagnose, auto-fix)
Quality ratchet: standards only go UP
Performance-per-token tracking (cost per ad, quality per dollar)
Agentic orchestration (researcher, writer, editor, evaluator agents)
Competitive intelligence (analyze patterns from Meta Ad Library)

Final Notes
The system that wins is the one that knows what's good. Not the one that generates the most, or uses the fanciest model, but the one that can reliably distinguish excellent from mediocre and push its output toward excellent.
Core principles:

Decomposition over holistic judgment
Measurable dimensions over subjective assessment
Iterative improvement over one-shot generation
ROI awareness over unlimited token spending
YOUR thinking over the AI's output

Build a system that gets better at making ads, and knows that it's getting better.

Philosophy
We evaluate YOUR thinking and judgment as much as the system's output. A well-reasoned decision log with honest limitations is worth more than a polished demo with no explanation of how you got there.

What Separates Good from Great
Good submissions build a pipeline that generates ads, scores them, and shows improvement.
Great submissions build a system that knows what good looks like, filters its own output ruthlessly, learns from failures, and can explain every decision. The candidate's thinking is visible throughout.

Ad Copy Structure on Meta
Every FB/IG ad has these components. Your system should generate all of them:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Brand Name] · Sponsored        │
│                                 │
│ PRIMARY TEXT                    │ ← Main copy. Stops the scroll.
│ (up to ~125 chars visible,     │   Most important element.
│  "...See More" after that)     │
│                                 │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │                             │ │
│ │         IMAGE               │ │ ← Creative (v2 scope)
│ │                             │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                 │
│ HEADLINE                        │ ← Bold, below image. Short.
│ Description text                │ ← Often truncated on mobile.
│ [CTA Button]                    │ ← "Learn More", "Sign Up", etc.
└─────────────────────────────────┘
Tips:

Primary text: First line is everything. Hook or lose them.
Headline: 5-8 words max. Benefit-driven.
Description: Optional reinforcement. Don't rely on it.
CTA button: Match the funnel stage. "Learn More" for awareness, "Sign Up" for conversion.


Evaluation Workflow
Here's the loop your system should implement:
Brief → Generate Ad → Score (5 dimensions) → Above 7.0?
├─ Yes → Add to library
└─ No  → Identify weakest dimension
        → Targeted regeneration
        → Re-score
        → Track improvement
Key decisions you'll make:

How many regeneration attempts before giving up on a brief?
Do you regenerate the whole ad or just the weak parts?
How do you prevent the feedback loop from optimizing one dimension at the expense of others?
When do you use expensive models vs. cheap ones?


The Five Dimensions
Your evaluation framework scores every ad on these:

Clarity — Can you get the message in <3 seconds?
Value Proposition — Is the benefit specific and compelling?
Call to Action — Is the next step obvious and low-friction?
Brand Voice — Does it sound like Varsity Tutors?
Emotional Resonance — Does it tap into real motivation?

See examples/evaluation-sample.json in this repo for the expected output format.

What Works on Meta Right Now
Patterns from high-performing edtech ads:
Hooks that stop the scroll:

Question hooks: "Is your child's SAT score holding them back?"
Stat hooks: "Students who prep score 200+ points higher on average."
Story hooks: "My daughter went from a 1050 to a 1400 in 8 weeks."
Fear hooks: "The SAT is 3 months away. Is your student ready?"

Body patterns:

Problem → agitate → solution → proof → CTA
Testimonial → benefit → CTA
Stat → context → offer → CTA

What converts:

Specific numbers ("200+ point improvement") > vague promises ("better scores")
Social proof (reviews, ratings, student counts) > claims
Urgency (deadlines, limited spots) > open-ended offers
Free trials/assessments > paid commitments as first step


Competitive Intelligence
Look at what competitors are running. The Meta Ad Library is free and public.
How to use it:

Go to facebook.com/ads/library
Search for: Princeton Review, Kaplan, Khan Academy, Chegg
Filter by active ads, US
Study: What hooks do they use? What CTAs? What visual styles?

What to look for:

Recurring copy patterns across multiple ads
CTAs that appear most often (these are likely winners)
Emotional angles (fear vs aspiration vs urgency)
How they handle specificity (numbers, timeframes, guarantees)

This is the "great artists steal" approach. Not copying—studying what shapes work and fitting your brand into them.

Strategic Hints
Most ads fail. In production, the majority of generated ads don't meet quality bar. The winning system generates many, evaluates ruthlessly, and surfaces only the best. Design for this from the start.
Performance per token. Every API call costs money. Track your cost per ad. Which model gives you the best quality-per-dollar? This matters at scale and it's what separates a prototype from a production system.
The taste problem. The hardest part isn't generation—it's evaluation. Can your system reliably tell an 8/10 ad from a 5/10? If it can, the rest is plumbing. If it can't, nothing else matters. Spend your time here.
Calibrate early. Before generating anything, run your evaluator against the reference ads provided via Slack. If it can't score the best ads high and the worst ads low, fix that before moving on.

Getting Started

 Study the reference ads provided via the Gauntlet/Nerdy Slack channel
 Build your evaluator first — score the reference ads, calibrate
 Build a simple generator — one audience, one offer
 Wire the feedback loop — generate, evaluate, regenerate
 Scale to 50+ ads, track quality trends
 Write your decision log as you go, not at the end
